# Flattening the Gigaword Datset

The scripts in this repository dump the text of the Gigaword dataset into a single file, for use 
with language modeling (and other!) toolkits.

See my [blog post on flattening the Gigaword corpus](https://blog.nelsonliu.me/2017/09/23/flattening-the-gigaword-corpus/) for 
more information about how the code in this repo works.

## Installation

To run this code, you must have **GNU Parallel**. This can be installed on Ubuntu with:

```
sudo apt-get install parallel
```

This project was developed in Python 3.6, but should work with Python 3.x and 2.x.
Please raise an issue if you find that this is not the case.

[Conda](https://conda.io/) will set up a virtual environment with the exact
version of Python used for development along with all the dependencies
needed to run the code in this package.

1.  [Download and install conda](https://conda.io/docs/download.html).

2.  Create a conda environment with Python 3.6.

    ```
    conda create -n flat python=3.6
    ```

3.  Now activate the conda environment.

    ```
    source activate flat
    ```

4.  Install the required dependencies with `pip`.

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    
## Usage

[`flatten_one_gigaword.py`](./flatten_one_gigaword.py) takes in the path of a Gigaword data file
and an output directory to write a flattened version to. The bash script at 
[`flatten_all_gigaword.sh`](./flatten_all_gigaword.sh) is a thin wrapper that feeds the paths of all the
Gigaword data files to [`flatten_one_gigaword.py`](./flatten_one_gigaword.py) and combines the final output.

[`flatten_all_gigaword.sh`](./flatten_all_gigaword.sh) takes in three positional arguments:

1.  The path to the Gigaword directory, with all of the data files unzipped.

2.  A directory to write the flattened files to and the final combined output. 
    It will be created if it does not exist.

3. The number of files to process at once.

For example, you can run:

```
./flatten_all_gigaword.sh ./data/cmn_gw_5/ tmp/ 24
```

to extract data (in parallel, processing 24 files at a time) from the Gigaword corpus 
at `./data/cmn_gw_5/` and write the flattened files + combined output to `tmp/`.
